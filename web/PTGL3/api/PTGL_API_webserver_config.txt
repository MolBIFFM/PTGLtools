You need:
 * Apache2 with 
     - mod_php5 
     - mod_rewrite
     
 * The .htaccess file present in the base dir (api/), which sets stuff for Slim (see Slim docs or here):
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
     
  * Allow setting rewriteEngine commands in the director (in the apache2 system cfg files)   
  <Directory "/path/to/my_ptgl3_web_dir/api">
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
     
  Ensure the Apache mods are enabled:
    # a2enmod rewrite
    ...
    
  For the images served by the API, you need the php fileinfo package installed: zypper in php5-fileinfo
    
  Also check in sysconfig:
    # grep "^APACHE_MODULES" /etc/sysconfig/apache2
    
  Then restart apache2:
    # service apache2 restart
