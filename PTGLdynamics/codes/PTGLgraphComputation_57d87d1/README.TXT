This directory contains the JAR and lib of PTGLgraphComputation (previously named plcc) from commit 57d87d1. This version is the last version able to correctly handle legacy PDB files. Take this version, if you have legacy PDB files. By using this version, you might loose functions implemented in the meantime. If you easily can switch to mmCIF format, you should do so and use the most recent version of PTGLgraphComputation.
