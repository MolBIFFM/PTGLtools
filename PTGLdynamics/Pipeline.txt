1.) Preprocessing PDB files
Adding COMPND part is optional. 
COMPND part helps PTGL to identify the molecule names.
If you want to add the COMPND part into the PDB files then
	1. uncomment the rows
	2. Add the text file 'COMPND.txt' which should contain the COMPND part of respective protein.

Example of a node in gml file with COMPND part:
	node [
		id 0
		label "1"
		mol_name "NADH-QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE SUBUNIT 1"
	]
without COMPND part:

	node [
		id 0
		label "A"
		mol_name ""
	]

Before executing pdbHandler.py make sure PDB files(, COMPND.txt) and pdbHandler are in the same directory.


2.) Generating DSSP files
dsspcmbi only works on Linux!
command:
./dsspcmbi pdbfilename.pdb > pdbfilename.dssp

3.)Analysis CG
Expectes file path to first and second graphs.
GML_compare_edge_weights_and_subsets.py path_to_first_CG path_to_second_CG

4.)Analysis PG
High variation-> comparison of DSSP code
