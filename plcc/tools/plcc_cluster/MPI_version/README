This is the README for the openMPI version of the vplg cluster scripts.

Written by ts.

ABOUT THESE SCRIPTS
====================

This version allows you to use all cores of each node. An OpenPBS script is available to submit the jobs to the PBS cluster queue as well.

Note that the files in this directory (plcc_cluster/MPI_version/)also use scripts from the level above it (plcc_cluster/).


USING THESE SCRIPTS
====================

You should use the following steps to run the MPI version:

0) 0.0) Copy the plcc.jar file, splitpdb.jar file and the 'lib' directory from your VPLG installation to the 'plcc_cluster/plcc_run/' subdirectory. Install dsspcmbi.

1) Adapt settings in settings_statistics.cfg and the other script files (output path, plcc command line options, path to dssp, etc.).
1.1) Run PLCC once (to make it create the config at ~/.plcc_settings) and edit the settings, e.g., database server credentials

2) Update your local copy of the PDB (you can use the rsync script provided on the RCSB website).
2.1) Optional: Update your local copy of the DSSP database (rsync script on DSSP website) and set path to it in settings_statistics.cfg

3.1) Create the list of PDB files to handle (plcc_cluster/status/dbinsert_file_list.lst) using the scripts in the plcc_cluster/ dir.

  You should have a look at the settings section at the top of the script 'create_job_filelists_MPI_version.sh', and then run it. You+
  may want to add the parameter 'all'.
   
  The script now also splits the list into chunks automatically. The number of chunks is up to you, but if your cluster has n nodes,
  you should create at least n chunks. More wont hurt, of course. Again, see the settings section of the script.
 
  The files 'plcc_cluster/status/filelistMPInumXXX' should exist afterwards.

4) Use the following command to run the MPI version:

  ./start_all_jobs_on_all_nodes_for_whole_PDB.sh

  This will qsub each generated file list as a single job.
