These are example PDB and DSSP input files. Most of the are here for a special reason (to test special stuff):

* 8icd: Standard protein, nothing special here. A single chain.
* 7tim: Rather a standard protein. Two chains, both with ligands. Contains the motif 'TIM barrel' in chains A and B.
* 1o1d: Insect flight muscle section. Very large, more than 90000 atoms and more than 30 chains.
* 1lmb: The lambda repressor-operator complex, contains a DNA chain.
* 1trz: Insulin, contains a sulfur bridge.
* 1gos: The beta graph of chain B contains a folding graph (FG) with a large and beautiful sequential ordering (for KEY notation drawing). It is FG #3, the connected component consisting of the SSEs (9, 8, 29, 30, 31, 27, 35), numbers indicate index of SSE in chain/PG, of course.
* 2zp6: Insulin, an example for a protein with interchain contacts (complex graphs), also used in Marcus' bechelor thesis
* 1cpr: Cytochrome C, an example for a protein which contains the motif '4-helix bundle'.
* 3kmf: Human hemoglobin, example for a protein which contains the motif 'globin fold' in the chains C and G.
* 1ave: Avidin, which contains the motif 'up and down barrel' (a type of beta barrel)
* 1ad0: Human antibody part, which contains the motif 'immunoglobin fold'
* 1b9x: Phosducin and transducin, which contains the motif 'beta propeller'
* 1ayn: Human rhinovirus coat protein, contains the motif 'jelly roll' (a type of beta barrel)
* 1aar: Diubiquitin conjugate, contains the motif 'ubiquitin roll'
