PTGL3 web server installation guide
====================================

To install your own PTGL3 web server, you will need the following:

  * a linux computer cluster to compute the data 
  
  * root access to a linux server with 
    - at least 450 GB free disk space
    - the VPLG software suite to create the graph data from the PDB and DSSP data (http://sourceforge.net/projects/vplg/).
      VPLG computes and saves graph data to the data dir (these files are served by the web server) and fills the database.
      
      See the VPLG documentation and the plcc_cluster documentation for details. (This takes weeks on a single desktop computer!)
    
    
  * basic linux admin & security skills (installing and configuring Apache2 and a PostgreSQL database server is not explained in this document)
  
  
Installing the PTGL3 server
============================

  - install the webserver and configure a web directory for the PTGL3 (e.g., /srv/www/htdocs/PTGL3/)
    (make sure that php-zip support and -postgresql support is installed)
  
  
  - copy the web interface PHP there
  
  
  - edit the config file and set database credentials (cfg file should now be at: /srv/www/htdocs/PTGL3/backend/config.php)
  
    The database should contain the data computed by VPLG. The database size is > 14 GB.
    
    
  - copy the data computed by VPLG to the data dir (unless changed in cfg file, this is now: /srv/www/htdocs/PTGL3/data/). 
  
    Note: This is > 380 GB for the whole PDB.
    
    
  - make sure that the Apache user can read the whole PTGL3 www-dir AND that he can write to PTGL3/temp_downloads/ and PTGL3/temp_data/.
  
  
That's it.
