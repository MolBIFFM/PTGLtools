These are example PDB and DSSP input files. Most of the are here for a special reason (to test special stuff):

* 8icd: Standard protein, nothing special here. A single chain.
* 7tim: Rather a standard protein. Two chains, both with ligands and beautiful, large tim barrels.
* 1o1d: Very large, more than 90000 atoms and more than 30 chains.
* 1lmb: Contains a DNA chain.
* 1trz: Contains a sulfur bridge.
