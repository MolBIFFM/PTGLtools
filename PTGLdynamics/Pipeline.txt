1.) Pre-processing of file in PDB file format
The python script pdbHandler.py converts files in legacy PDB file format.
To add a COMPND part as header
	-uncomment row ...
	-add 'COMPND.txt' with respective COMPND part

PTGL can identify molecule names due to the COMND part of the protein.
Node in GML of CG file generated with COMPND.txt as input  
	node [
		id 0
		label "1"
		mol_name "NADH-QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE SUBUNIT 1"
	]

and without COMPND part

	node [
		id 0
		label "A"
		mol_name ""
	]
Files in PDB file format(, COMPND.txt) and pdbHandler.py have to be in the ame directory. 
pdbHandler.py changes all files with the ending .pdb in the same directory.


2.) Generate DSSP file with DSSP program:
Only executable on Linux environment !
command:
./dsspcmbi pdbfilename.pdb > pdbfilename.dssp


3.) Analysis of Complex graphs (CGs)
GML expects two CGs as input and generates a CSV file with the differences of the edge weights. 
Then, the edges that are either present in the first graph but not in the second graph and vice versa 
are listed. If both graphs have identical edges, they have the same connectivity and show no structural 
change.
command:
python GML_compare_edge_weights_and_subsets.py path_to_CG1 path_to_CG2
