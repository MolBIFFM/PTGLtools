The perl program rpg.pl generates random protein graphs in dpg/plcc format.


INSTALLATION
============
Just 'chmod +x' it and make sure you have Perl installed (every UNIX system I have seen so far has Perl installed by default).



RUNNING IT
========== 
You can simply run it like this to use the default settings:

  ./rpg.pl

You can also specify the number of vertices, the edge probability and an output file in the script itself or on the command line.
Run './rpg.pl -h' for details on how to do this.


USING THE GRAPHS
================
You can draw them with the plcc program, see the plcc README on how to do that. Atm, this does it:

  java -jar plcc.jar IGNORED -l random_graph.plg

When drawing *very* large graphs (e.g., 1000 vertices), you may need to increase the heap space of the Java VM to prevent out-of-memory errors. See the Java docs.

Enjoy.
