To see the build tasks, run:
    gradle tasks

You can run the application itself, but passing command line args is very ugly. Here is how to pass '-h':

    gradle run -PappArgs="['-h']"

Make sure you have all the ticks and double-quotes! You can add more args to that array, e.g., ... ="['8icd.pdb', '-o', '8icd_split.pdb']"
