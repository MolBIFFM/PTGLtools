This is a checkout of the the sourceforge.net source code repository of VPLG.


   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               !!!!! WARNING !!!!!

    Atm this repository does NOT contain the latest version of the development code!

    The code for a certain release is always included in the src/ directory.

    Do NOT send me patches against the version in this repo! If you are interested
    in VPLG development, contact me via email.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that both the 'splitpdb' and the 'plcc' directories contain not only the
source code but the full Netbeans projects, so you should be able to open
them directly if you use the Netbeans IDE.
