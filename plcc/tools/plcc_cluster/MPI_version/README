This is the README for the openMPI version of the vplg cluster scripts.

Written by ts.

ABOUT THESE SCRIPTS
====================

This version allows you to use all cores of each node. An OpenPBS script is available to submit the jobs to the PBS cluster queue as well.

Note that the files in this directory (plcc_cluster/MPI_version/)also use scripts from the level above it (plcc_cluster/).


USING THESE SCRIPTS
====================

You should use the following steps to run the MPI version:

1) Adapt settings in settings_statistics and the other script files.

2) Update your local copy of the PDB.

3) Create the list of PDB files to handle (plcc_cluster/status/dbinsert_file_list_proc.lst) using the scripts in the plcc_cluster/ dir.

4) Use the following command to run the MPI version:

  qsub pbs_start_vplg_via_mpi4py.sh
