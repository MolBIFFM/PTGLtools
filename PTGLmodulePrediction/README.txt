This folder is part of the Supporting Information for the paper 'Graph-theoretical prediction of biological modules in  quaternary structures of large protein complexes' by Gisdon et al.

Jupyter notebooks with the workflow are available in the folder of the presented case studies
- ComplexI
- Phi29
- TRiC_CCT

Custom Python functions are available:    
- generalFunctions.py                 
- pymolRepresentationClustering.py   

The settings for Protein Topology Graph Computation (PTGL) software is provided in the file 'PTGLgraphComputation_settings.txt'. 
The relevant files for each case study are provided to run the examples without the software PTGL, DSSP, or PyMOL. Output files are provided.
