This is the VPLG release log.
=============================


Updates from version 2012-01-24 to 2012-01-30:
================================================
* Default rule set for atom and residue contacts is now PTGL compatible
* SSE contact rules changed for (H, E) contact pairs
* Javadoc fixes, old functions marked as deprecated
* Added lots of debug code and some new debug options
* It is now possible to restrict computations to a specific chain on the command line


Updates from version 2012-01-30 to 2012-02-21:
================================================
* fixed bitmap output support (-m)
* fixed some database-related security issues
* database structure has also been changed slightly
* output files can now be written to a directory tree similar to the PDB directory structure to avoid problems with thousands of output files in a single directory (-k)
* add support for gzipped input files
* many other fixes


Updates from version 2012-01-21 to 2012-04-17:
================================================
* support for deleting a protein from the database
* splitpdb now also supports gzipped input PDB files and can also write gzipped output files
* computation of a spatial vertex ordering of a graph if possible for the graph
* based on this vertex ordering, the KEY notation from the Protein Topology Graph Library can also be computed
* database layout changes and fixes
* work on similarity methods for protein graphs (--similar command line option, similarity src package)
* changed the values of some default settings inthe cfg file


Updates from version 2012-04-17 to 2012-06-05:
================================================
* option to filter ligands based on their atom count, e.g., you can configure the program to include only ligands which have between n and m atoms. You can set the borders n and m in the PLCC configuration file using the plcc_I_lig_min_atoms and plcc_I_lig_max_atoms options. Setting the former to 1 and the latter to a value <0 (which are the defaults) means that all ligands are considered.
* changes under the hood, most notably usage of generics for the graph classes to unify them and make all of them extend a single base class.
* lots of new output formats to allow the usage of graphs generated by VPLG with other software: 
   -GML: option to save the computed protein graphs to text files in Graph Modelling Language format (.gml files, see http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/fileadmin/files/lehrstuhl/brandenburg/projekte/gml/gml-technical-report.pdf by Himsolt or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language for more info). The GML output is on by default and can be turned off by modifying the plcc_B_output_GML option in the VPLG config file. With GML support, you can now load graphs generated by VPLG in programs like yEd () and Gephi (http://gephi.org/).
   -TGF: option to save the computed protein graphs to text files in Trivial Graph Format format (.tgf files). This output is on by default and can be turned off by modifying the plcc_B_output_TGF option in the VPLG config file.
   -DOT language: option to save the computed protein graphs to text files in DOT language format . This output is on by default and can be turned off by modifying the plcc_B_output_DOT option in the VPLG config file, it writes .gv files. This allows you to open the graphs with GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org/) and other software.
