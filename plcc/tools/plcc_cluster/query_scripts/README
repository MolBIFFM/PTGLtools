To use these query scripts, make sure you can access the PLCC database qithout password.

If your system user is 'ts' and you want to query the database 'vplg', edit your pgswl config files in /var/lib/pgsql/data/ like this:


add a line to pg_ident.conf:
"tsvplg		ts	vplg"	

and add these lines in pg_hba.conf, but NOT at the end, but before the ALL lines (first matched line counts, so adding at the end will most likely not do anything):

"local		vplg	vplg			trust"

and

"host		vplg	vplg	127.0.0.1/32	trust"

Better remove these mapping later.
