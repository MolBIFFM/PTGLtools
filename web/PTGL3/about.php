		<h3> What is PTGL 3? </h3>

		<p>
		PTGL 3 is a web-based database application for the analysis protein topologies. It uses a graph-based model to describe the structure
		of protein chains on the super-secondary structure level. A protein graph is computed from the 3D atomic coordinates of a single chain in
		a PDB file and the secondary structure assignments of the DSSP algorithm. The computation of the protein graph is done by our software <a href="http://www.bioinformatik.uni-frankfurt.de/tools/vplg/" target="_blank">Visualization of Protein Ligand Graphs (VPLG)</a>. In a protein graph graph, vertices represent secondary
		structure elements (SSEs, usually alpha helices and beta strands) or ligand molecules while the edges model contacts and relative orientations between
		them. The result is an undirected, labelled graph for a single protein chain.
		<br /><br /></p>
		
		<p class="imgCenter"><img src="./images/protein_graph.png" alt="Protein graph" title="Protein graph" class="img-responsive imgFormAboutphp"/></p>
		
		<br/>
		
		<br />
		<!--
		The most common and important SSEs in proteins are alpha helices and beta strands, and some structures in the PDB also contain ligands.
		So the PTGL contains 6 different graph types, which differ in the considered secondary structure elements (SSE). The three base graph types are the <a href="#alphaGraph">Alpha graph</a>, the <a href="#betaGraph">Beta graph</a>,
		and the <a href="#alphaBetaGraph">Alpha-Beta graph</a>. If you are interested in the ligands as well, you can also use the <a href="#alphaLigGraph">Alpha-Ligand graph</a>, the <a href="#betaLigGraph">Beta-Ligand graph</a>,
		and the <a href="#alphaBetaLigGraph">Alpha-Beta-Ligand graph</a>
		-->
		
		<!--
		The connected components of the <a href="#proteinGraph">Protein graph</a> form <a href="#foldingGraph">Folding graphs</a>. A <a href="#proteinGraph">Protein graph</a> can consist of one or more
		<a href="#foldingGraph">Folding graphs</a>. The three graph types were defined for each protein of the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/" target="_blank">PDB</a>. For each graph type exists four <a href="#linearNot">linear notations</a> with
		corresponding graphic representations. In PTGL all <a href="#foldingGraph">Folding graphs</a>, all SSEs, and additional protein information are stored for every
		protein structure annotated in <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/" target="_blank">PDB</a> for which SSEs according DSSP are defined, which is not a NMR structure, has a resolution less than 3.5
		Ã… and a sequence length of at least 20 amino acids. The database enables the user to search for the topology of a protein or for certain
		topologies and subtopologies using the <a href="#linearNot">linear notations</a>. Additionally, it could be searched for sequence similarity in <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/" target="_blank">PDB</a> sequences.

		<h3> Protein Graphs </h3>

		<p>Using the 3D structure data from the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/" target="_blank">PDB</a>, the SSEs are defined according to
		the assignment of the <a href="http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/" target="_blank">DSSP</a> algorithm with some 
		modifications. Then, the spatial
		contacts between the SSEs are computed according to <a href="publications.php">Koch <i>et al.</i>, 2013</a>. For the ligand versions, the explanation can
		be found in <a href="publications.php">Sch&auml;fer <i>et al.</i>, 2012</a>. This information forms the basis for the description of protein structures as
		graphs.</p>
		
		<p>
		A Protein graph is defined as labelled, undirected graph. The vertices correspond to the SSEs or ligands, and they are labelled with
		the SSE type (alpha helix, beta strand or ligand). The vertices of the Protein graph are enumerated as they occur in the sequence from the N- to the C-terminus.
		
		
		<!--
		According to the type of atoms forming the contact, there are backbone-backbone-contacts, sidechain-sidechain-contacts, and sidechain-backbone
		contacts. Two vertices are connected, if there are at least two backbone-backbone-contacts or two sidechain-backbone-contacts or three
		sidechain-sidechain contacts.-->
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The edges of the Protein graph represent spatial adjacencies of SSEs. These adjacencies are defined through atom contacts between SSEs, based on the van-der-Waals radius.
		According to this direction two spatial neighboured SSEs, which are connected, could have a parallel (p), anti-parallel (a), or mixed (m)
		neighbourhood. 
		</p>
		
		<br/>
		<a class="anchor" id="graphTypes"></a>
		<h4> Graph Types </h4>
		
		<p>		
		If only a certain SSE type is of interest, the graph modelling allows to exclude the non-interesting SSE types.
		According to the SSE type of interest, the Protein graph can be defined as an <a href="#alphaGraph">Alpha graph</a>, <a href="#betaGraph">Beta graph</a>, or <a href="#alphaBetaGraph">Alpha-Beta graph</a>.
		If you are interested in the ligands as well, you can also use the <a href="#alphaLigGraph">Alpha-Ligand graph</a>, the <a href="#betaLigGraph">Beta-Ligand graph</a>,
		and the <a href="#alphaBetaLigGraph">Alpha-Beta-Ligand graph</a>.</p>
		
		<p>
		The Alpha graph only contains alpha helices and the contacts between them. The Alpha-Beta graph contains alpha helices, beta strands and the contacts betweem them. And so on.
		</p>
		
		<a class="anchor" id="explainImages"></a>
		<h3>Interpreting the graph images</h3>

		<p>
		In the graph visualizations available on the PTGL server, the SSEs
		are ordered as red circles (helices), black quadrats (strands), or magenta rings (ligands) on a straight line according to their sequential order from the N- to
		the C-terminus. The spatial neighbourhoods are drawn as arcs between SSEs. The edges are coloured according to their labelling, red for
		parallel, green for mixed, blue for anti-parallel, and magenta for ligand neighbourhood. Here is the key for the images:

		<a class="anchor" id="foldingGraph"></a>
		<h4> <u>Folding Graphs</u> </h4>
		<p>A connected component of the <a href="#proteinGraph">Protein graph</a> is called Folding graph. Folding graphs are denoted with capital letters in alphabetical order
		according to their occurrence in the sequence, beginning at the N-terminus.</p>

		<p><a href="#proteinGraph">Protein graphs</a> are built of one or more Folding graphs. Below, you find the <a href="#rasmolbec">schematic representation</a> of the antigen receptor protein 1BEC
		(figure from the <a href="http://www.fli-leibnitz.de/cgi-bin/ImgLib.pl?Code=1BEC">Jena Library of Biological Macromoleculs</a>). Helices are coloured red and strands blue. 1BEC is a transport membrane protein
		that detects foreign molecules at the cell surface. It has two domains, which are represented by the Folding graphs A and E, which are mainly
		built by strands. The protein consists of one chain A and exhibits six Folding graphs. Two large Folding graphs (Folding graphs 1BEC_A and
		1BEC_E), and four Folding graphs 1BEC_B, 1BEC_C, 1BEC_D, and 1BEC_F consisting only of a single helix (see <href="#alphaBeta1bec">Protein graph of 1bec</a>: helices 9,
		11, 14, and 22). Folding graphs consisting of only one SSE are found mostly at the protein surface and not in the protein core.</p>
		Especially in beta-sheet containing Folding graphs, the maximal vertex degree of the Folding graphs is not larger than two. Thus, we distinguish
		between so-called bifurcated and non-bifurcated topological structures. A <a href="#proteinGraph">Protein graph</a> or a Folding graph is called bifucated, if there is any
		vertex degree greater than 2, if not, the graph is non- bifurcated.

		<a class="anchor" id="linearNot"></a>
		<h4> <u>Linear Notations</u> </h4>
		<p>A notation serves as a unique, canonical, and linear description and classification of structures. The notations for Folding graphs reveal to
		the feature of protein structure as a linear sequence of amino acids, and describe the arrangement of SSEs correctly and completely.</p>
		<p>There are two possibilities of representing Protein graphs: first, one can order the SSEs in one line according to their occurrence in sequence,
		or second, according to their occurrence in space. In the first case, the <a href="#adj">adjacent</a> notation, ADJ, the <a href="#red">reduced</a> notation, RED, and the <a href="#seq">sequence</a>
		notation, SEQ, SSEs are ordered as points on a straight line according to their sequential order from the N- to the C-terminus.</p>
		<p>It is difficult to draw the spatial arrangements of the SSEs in a straight line, because in most proteins SSEs exhibit more than two spatial
		neighbours. Therefore, the second description type, the <a href="#key">key</a> notation, KEY, can be drawn only for non-bifurcated Folding graphs. Helices and
		strands are represented by cylinders and arrows, respectively. The sequential neighbourhood is described by arcs between arrows and cylinders.</p>
		The notations are written in different brackets: [] denote non-bifurcated, {} bifurcated folding graphs, and () indicate barrel structures. 
		<div class="topLink"><a href="#" class="topLink"><i class="fa fa-2x fa-long-arrow-up"></i></a></div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<a class="anchor" id="adj"></a>
		<a class="anchor" id="red"></a>
		<h5> <u>The adjucent and reduced notation</u> </h5>
		<p>All vertices of the <a href="#proteinGraph">Protein graph</a> are considered in the adjacent (ADJ) notation of a Folding graph. SSEs of the Folding graph are ordered
		according to their occurrence in the sequence. Beginning with the first SSE and following the spatial neighbourhoods the sequential distances
		are noted followed by the neighbourhood type.</p>
		The reduced (RED) notation is the same as for ADJ notation, but only those SSEs of the considered Folding graph count. See below, the ADJ and
		RED notations of the Beta-Folding graph E in human alpha thrombin chain B(1D3T). The beta sheet consists of six strands arranged both in
		parallel with one additional mixed edge to helix 12. 

		<h5> <u>ADJ Notation</u> </h5>
			<p><img src="./images/1d3tBEa_albe.png" alt="Adjacent notation" title="Adjacent notation" class="img-responsive imgFormAboutphp"/></p>
		<h5> <u>RED Notation</u> </h5>
			<p><img src="./images/1d3tBEr_albe.png" alt="Reduced notation" title="Reduced notation" class="img-responsive imgFormAboutphp"/></p>
		<div class="topLink"><a href="#" class="topLink"><i class="fa fa-2x fa-long-arrow-up"></i></a></div>

		<br>
		<br>
		<a class="anchor" id="key"></a>
		<h5> <u>KEY Notation</u> </h5>
		The KEY notation is very close to the topology diagrams of biologists, e.g. BrÃ¤ndÃ©n and Tooze (1999). Topologies are described by diagrams of
		arrows for strands and cylinders for helices. As in the <a href="#red">RED</a> notation SSEs of the considered Folding graph are taken into account. SSEs are
		ordered spatially and are connected in sequential order. Beginning with the first SSE in the sequence and following the sequential edges,
		the spatial distances are noted; in <a href="#alphaBetaGraph">Alpha-Beta</a> graphs followed by the type of the SSE, h for a helix and e for a strand. If the arrangement
		of SSEs is parallel an x is noted (Richardson(1977)). In this case the protein chain moves on the other side of the sheet by crossing the
		sheet (cross over). Antiparallel arrangements are called same end, and are more stable, Chothia and Finkelstein (1990). Mixed arrangements
		are defined as same end. The notation starts with the type of the first SSE. See the KEY notation of the <a href="#alphaBetaGraph">Alpha-Beta</a> <a href="#foldingGraph">Folding graph</a> B chain
		B of the histocompatibility antigen (1IEB). The Folding graph consists of 3 helices and 4 strands. This topology exhibits one cross over
		connection from helix 6 to helix 7 and forms an <a href="#alphaBetaGraph">Alpha-Beta</a> barrel structure.

		<br>
		<br>
		<a class="anchor" id="seq"></a>
		<h5> <u>SEQ Notation</u> </h5>
		This notation is the same as the <a href="#adj">ADJ</a> notation, but the sequential differences are counted. Although the SEQ notation is trivial, the notation
		can be useful, for example, searching for Ïˆ-loops requires a special SEQ notation.
