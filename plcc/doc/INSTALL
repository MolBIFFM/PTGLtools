How to install VPLG
===================


Make sure you have Java >= 1.6 installed (the JRE will do, you do not need the SDK). You can run 'java -version' if
in doubt. 


After unpacking the release archive, all tools can be run directly from the resulting directory structure. 


   cd downloads/
   unzip vplg-<version>.zip

   cd vplg/
   java -jar plcc.jar
  

Note that the programs require the libraries in the lib/, relative to their path. So if you copy them elsewhere, you
gotta copy the lib/ directory there as well.


See the README_* files for more detailed instructions on how to install and use the tools.
