The program files for step 1 - 3 are located in the "codes" directory and can be executed with the script PTGLdynamics.py or on their own.

1.) Pre-processing of file in PDB file format
The python script toLegacyPDB.py converts files in legacy PDB file format.

PTGL can identify molecule names due to the COMND part of the protein.
Node in GML of CG file generated with COMPND.txt as input  
	node [
		id 0
		label "1"
		mol_name "NADH-QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE SUBUNIT 1"
	]

and without COMPND part

	node [
		id 0
		label "A"
		mol_name ""
	]
 
toLegacyPDB.py changes all files with the ending .pdb in the specified directory.


2.) Generate DSSP file with DSSP program:
Only executable on Linux environment !
command:
./dsspcmbi pdbfilename.pdb > pdbfilename.dssp


3.) Analysis of Complex graphs (CGs)
gmlCompareEdgeWeightsAndSubsets.py expects two CGs as input and generates a CSV file with the differences of the edge weights. 
Then, the edges that are either present in the first graph but not in the second graph and vice versa 
are listed. If both graphs have identical edges, they have the same connectivity and show no structural 
change.

optional [4.) Analysis of Protein graphs (PGs)]
